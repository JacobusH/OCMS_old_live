                        <h3>How often do students take lessons?</h3>
                        To get the most out of your lessons, we recommend that you take at least one lesson per week. We believe that everyone learns at their own pace, so it is completely up to you how many lessons you would like to take each month. Most students start with 4 lessons per month, but some take only 2 while others take 8 or more lessons per month. You always have the option to change the frequency of your lessons as you go along.
                     </div>
                     
                     <h3>What is your cancellation policy?</h3>
                     At Orange County Music School School, you are not bound by any long-term commitments and with proper notification, you can cancel your lessons at any time. For new students, if you want to stop after your first lesson, please contact us within 72 hours of the first lesson and you will not be billed. For currently enrolled students, please let us know before the 25th of the month, in order to cancel lessons from the next month. 

                     <h3>How do I know my instructor is qualified?</h3>
                     All of our instructors have degrees in music and several years of teaching experience. Please ask for more information when you call us, and we'll be happy to share the details with you.

                     <h3>How much do you charge for lessons?</h3>
                     All lesson rates vary depending on the length of the lesson and the number of lessons taken per month by you and your family. Please call or email us and we'll be happy to provide you with an exact cost based on your specific requirements.

                     <h3>Do you offer a free trial lesson?</h3>
                     Yes, we offer one free introductory lesson per family. Please call or email and we can schedule one for you.

                     <h3>Can I speak with the instructor before I book the lesson?</h3> 
                     Absolutely. Just call (714) 573-1449 and ask for Stella Kotova.

                     <h3>How do I choose between private and group lessons?</h3>
                     That really depends on the age and experience level of the student, and what they are trying to accomplish. Feel free to call and talk to us, we'll be happy to help you with the decision. Both private and group lessons have their own advantages, so it really depends on your specific requirements. 

                     <h3>How and when do I pay for the lesson?</h3>
                     Fees are paid monthly, at the beginning of each month. You can mail us a check, or pay during your first lesson of the month. 

                     <h3>Do I need to have my own instrument?</h3>
                     For your first lesson, we recommend you use the instructor's instrument so you can make sure you want to continue with the lessons. If you decide to continue with lessons, you should get your own instrument as soon as possible, so you can practice at home. Your instructor will be able to make some recommendations. For students taking piano lessons, you will need a full-sized keyboard with at least 5 octaves, a digital piano, or preferably a well tuned upright or grand piano.

                     <h3>What is your rescheduling policy?</h3>
                     We are very flexible, and we ask that you give us as much advance notice as possible in order to reschedule your lesson.

                     <h3>What ages of students can enroll in lessons?</h3> 
                     We accept students ages 4 and up for most lessons. Based on the age and experience of the student, we will do our best to place them with a qualified instructor who will meet their specific needs. 

                     <h3>Where are you located?</h3> 
                     In the city of Tustin, CA. Please see the contact page for more information.

                     <h3>Do you offer family discounts?</h3>
                     No, but we keep our prices low for everyone. Our prices are almost always lower than that of any other music school or music instructor in the area.

                     <h3>What if I am going to be away for some of my lessons?</h3> 
                     We are very flexible, and we ask that you give us as much advance notice as possible. If you will be away on vacation, please let us know and you will not be billed for those dates. You can also schedule make up lessons before and after your vacation, if you choose to do so.
